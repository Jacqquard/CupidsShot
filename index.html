                <p>We have known each other for a long time, and during this time you have become more than just an acquaintance, a person who has turned my world upside down. For the last two months, I have been living in some incredible state that is difficult to describe in words. It feels like I have found something precious, something that makes my heart beat faster, and my thoughts are carried far beyond the boundaries of everyday life. You are the warmth, comfort, and light that I feel every time you are around. Each of our meetings is an event for me that I look forward to with trepidation and impatience. I am like a child anticipating something magical, because I know that with you, I will feel like I am in his place, in his world, where everything is right and looks right. You are like a home that I want to return to again and again, where it is warm, cozy, and safe. This is not just comfort - it is something much more, something that I cannot express in one word. This feeling is as if the whole world around freezes, and only we remain, our conversations, your smile, and the warmth that you radiate. When I think about you, my heart seems to fly into space, into orbit, where there is nothing but endless happiness and lightness. Your eyes are a whole universe in which I see care, kindness, sincerity and warmth. They are more beautiful than any landscape, brighter than any star in the galaxy. I could look at them forever, because they contain the whole world that I want to explore again and again. Your soul is what makes you so special, so different from others. It shines like a beacon in the night, attracting and giving hope. Your character is a rare treasure. You are not just kind, you are the embodiment of kindness, sincerity and understanding. You can talk to you about anything, from the simplest things to philosophical topics. And even if our tastes or views differ, this never becomes an obstacle. You know how to listen, support, be close to what I consider myself listenable and understandable. Your humor is like sparks that make every conversation we have in the garden, and your care is like a warm blanket that you want to wrap yourself in. You are tactile, and every gesture, every touch is like a small bridge that connects us even more. Your voice is a separate magic. It is like the whisper of the ocean that speaks in a shell, gentle, calming and infinitely beautiful. When you simply say "hello", I feel warmth spreading inside me, my heart stops, as if waiting for a miracle. Your voice is a melody that can freeze time, like winter air on a frosty day, but at the same time warm the soul with its tenderness. It sounds like the voice of an angel, and I am ready to listen to it endlessly. You are a person who puts into herself all the best that can be. Kindness, sincerity, honesty, humor, care - all this is intertwined in you into an amazing pattern that makes you so unique. You are not afraid to be sincere, to tell the truth, even if it is not simple. There is not a drop of hypocrisy in you, and this makes you even more valuable. You are like a ray of light that cannot be extinguished, like a star that always shines, even on the darkest nights. When we first met, I could not imagine that our communication would go so far. Then you were just a person who was preferred among others, but I did not even suspect that you finally entered my life deeply. With each of our meetings, I increasingly understood that you are not just someone, you are special. Such warm, bright energy emanates from you, which envelops and makes the world around you better. You are the person with whom I want to share everything, joys, meetings, dreams. I feel that I can trust you with everything I have - my thoughts, my feelings, my soul. For the last two months, I have been living in some kind of prosperous state. Each meeting with you is a storm of emotions that cannot be described. This is not just sympathy, this is something much more, a being that turns me inside out. I thought for a long time how to express everything that I feel, how to find the right words to convey a small part of what is going on in my heart. I was afraid that all the words would not be able to express my feelings, but I can no longer remain silent. {girl's name}, I thought about my feelings, my intentions, my words for a long time. I realized that I can no longer keep it to myself, because you are the person for whom I want to be better, for whom I want to live brighter. You are my light, my comfort, my space. And I want to ask you a question that has been spinning in my head for a long time, which I did not dare to return to for so long. {girl's name}, these feelings that I have for you, are they important?</p>

                <p>Let's meet in that very place, at 7:00 PM, on that very day before your departure, where everything around seems special because you will be there. I want all our emotions, everything we feel, to be revealed right there, in that moment that I am already anticipating. I will wait for you with impatience, with warmth, with hope for a new step. If suddenly something changes, write to me in advance - I will treat any of your decisions with understanding and will not interfere with our meeting. Until next time, {girl's name}.</p>

                <p>Thank you for your honesty. I appreciate that you found the strength to openly share your feelings, and I respect your answer, even if it is not what I was hoping for. You are an incredible person, and that will not change no matter what our path will be further. Over these nine months of our communication, you gave me so much warmth, light and inspiration that I will be grateful for every moment spent with you. Your kindness, sincerity, your laughter and your unique energy - all this will remain with me as a precious memory. I do not regret anything that happened between us, because each of our meetings, each conversation made me a better person, showed me what real warmth and comfort are. I understand that feelings are a complex and subtle matter, and they do not always coincide. And this is okay. I do not want you to feel awkward or obligated. You have always been honest, and this is one of the traits that I value so much in you. If you want, I would be happy to keep in touch because you are the kind of person who is always a pleasure to be around, even just as a friend. If you need time or space, I completely respect that. You are amazing, and I wish you nothing but the best – for your light to shine as brightly as it always does, and for you to be surrounded by people who appreciate you as much as you deserve. Thank you for everything you have given me and for who you are. {girl's name}, I will always be here if you want to continue our conversation, I will be waiting for your answer.</p>
